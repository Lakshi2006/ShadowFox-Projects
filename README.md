# üè¶ Loan Approval Prediction with Machine Learning

**Predict loan approval decisions using machine learning** 

---

## üìå Problem Statement
Loan approval prediction is a critical challenge in fintech. This project uses machine learning to analyze credit history, income, employment status, and other financial attributes to build an intelligent system for automating loan approval decisions. The goal is to minimize risk while ensuring fair access to credit.

## üìÇ Dataset
**Source**: [Loan Approval Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18nheKtzhesFv_M6DB081dcmvphQXs7st?usp=sharing)  


**Features**:
- Applicant financial history
- Income level
- Credit score
- Employment status
- Loan amount & term
- Collateral information

## üõ† Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize correlations between features.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features like Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio.
4. **Model Training**: Test algorithms including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize models using GridSearchCV.
6. **Evaluation**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC metrics.
